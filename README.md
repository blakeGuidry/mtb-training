# The 28-Week Mountain Bike Peak Performance Plan

## Section 1: Foundational Benchmarking & The "Dual-Zone" System

To develop a precise, effective training plan, it is first necessary to establish accurate physiological benchmarks.
This plan will operate on a "Dual-Zone" system, calibrating two separate sets of training zones: one based on Heart Rate (HR) for outdoor mountain bike training (which lacks a power meter) and one based on Power (FTP) for indoor Peloton training.

### 1.1 Protocol 1: Establishing Cycling Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR)

All outdoor ride intensities will be prescribed based on the Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR).
LTHR is the exertion level above which fatigue accumulates rapidly, making it the most reliable anchor for setting endurance training zones.
A critical clarification is required: the LTHR detection features on Garmin watches (even those with "Auto Detection" or "Guided Tests") are overwhelmingly designed for and validated by running.
Lactate threshold is sport-specific; a running LTHR is physiologically different from a cycling LTHR and cannot be used interchangeably.
Therefore, the following 30-minute cycling-specific field test protocol must be performed outdoors on the mountain bike, using the Garmin watch and heart rate monitor.

**LTHR Field Test Protocol:**

1.  **Warm-up:** Complete 15-20 minutes of easy spinning, gradually increasing intensity.
2.  **Main Set:** Begin a 30-minute sustained time trial. The objective is to ride at the fastest, most consistent pace possible for the entire 30 minutes. Pacing is critical; avoid starting too hard and fading, as this will skew the results.
3.  **Data Capture:** Exactly 10 minutes into the 30-minute effort, press the "Lap" button on the Garmin watch. This isolates the final 20 minutes of the test.
4.  **Finish:** Complete the 30-minute time trial.
5.  **Cool-down:** Perform 10-15 minutes of very easy (Zone 1) spinning.
6.  **Analyze:** After saving the activity, review the data on the Garmin watch or in Garmin Connect. The LTHR benchmark for this plan is the average heart rate for the final 20-minute lap of the test.

This LTHR test should be repeated after Mesocycle 3 (post-winter races) and again after Mesocycle 6 (mid-build phase) to re-calibrate zones as fitness improves.

### 1.2 Protocol 2: Establishing Peloton Functional Threshold Power (FTP)

All indoor Peloton ride intensities will be prescribed based on Functional Threshold Power (FTP), which is the foundation of Peloton's "Power Zone Training".

**FTP Test Protocol:**

1.  **Preparation:** Locate the FTP Test on the Peloton platform. This typically involves a 15-minute FTP warm-up ride followed by the 20-minute test itself.
2.  **Test:** Complete the 20-minute FTP test. As with the LTHR test, pacing is key to achieving an accurate result.
3.  **Analysis:** The Peloton system will automatically calculate the FTP, which is typically 95% of the average power from the 20-minute test.
4.  **Peloton Setup:** Enter this new FTP number into the Peloton user profile settings. This action will automatically calibrate the 7 Power Zones used in all Power Zone classes.

### 1.3 Defining Your Training Zones

With the LTHR and FTP benchmarks established, the following two 7-zone models will serve as the "Rosetta Stone" for this plan. A 7-zone model is selected over 5-zone models because it provides superior granularity, particularly in separating Zone 2 (Endurance) from Zone 3 (Tempo)-a distinction that is foundational for building the deep aerobic base required for stage racing.

#### Table 1: Outdoor Training - 7-Zone Heart Rate (HR) Model (Based on the Coggan/Garmin 7-Zone %LTHR Model)

| Zone | Name | % of LTHR | Perceived Exertion (RPE) | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Z1** | Active Recovery | <68% | <2/10 | Promotes recovery |
| **Z2** | Endurance | 69-83% | 2-3/10 | Builds aerobic base, "all-day" pace |
| **Z3** | Tempo | 84-94% | 3-4/10 | "Comfortably hard," improves muscular endurance |
| **Z4** | Lactate Threshold | 95-105% | 4-5/10 | Increases sustained high-intensity capacity |
| **Z5** | VO2 Max | >106% | 6-7/10 | Boosts maximum aerobic power |
| **Z6** | Anaerobic Capacity | N/A (HR lag) | >7/10 | Short, maximal efforts |
| **Z7** | Neuromuscular | N/A (HR lag) | Maximal | Sprints |

#### Table 2: Indoor Training - 7-Zone Power (FTP) Model (Based on the Coggan/Allen 7-Zone %FTP Model)

| Zone | Name | % of FTP | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Z1** | Active Recovery | <55% | Active recovery |
| **Z2** | Endurance | 56-75% | Aerobic base building |
| **Z3** | Tempo | 76-90% | Muscular endurance |
| **Z4** | Lactate Threshold | 91-105% | Raises FTP |
| **Z5** | VO2 Max | 106-120% | Max aerobic capacity |
| **Z6** | Anaerobic Capacity | 121-150% | Anaerobic capacity |
| **Z7** | Neuromuscular | >150% | Max power |

### 1.4 Peloton Class Glossary

The Peloton class library will be used strategically to meet the specific physiological goals of this plan.

* **Power Zone Endurance (PZE):** This will be the primary tool for all Z2 and Z3 workouts. These classes build the aerobic base and are the workhorse of this plan.
* **Power Zone / Power Zone Max:** These classes will be used for structured Z4 (Threshold) and Z5 (VO2 Max) intervals.
* **Climb Rides:** These classes are essential for building muscular endurance and sustained, high-torque (high resistance, lower cadence) efforts. This is a specific preparatory tool for the terrain of Fat Chuck's Revenge, which is described as "non-stop up and down".
* **HIIT / Tabata Rides:** These classes will be used for unstructured Z5/Z6 intervals and to sharpen top-end fitness.
* **Low Impact / Recovery Rides:** These will be used for Z1 active recovery sessions.

## Section 2: Macrocycle 1 (Weeks 1-7): The Winter Campaign (Fat Chuck's & Excruciate Exam)

This 7-week macrocycle is designed to rapidly build, sharpen, and peak for the two winter races. The structure is a 3-week build, 1-week taper, 1-week race (Fat Chuck's), 1-week recovery, and 1-week reload/race (Excruciate Exam).

### 2.1 Mesocycle 1 - Build & Peak (Weeks 1-4)

The goal of this 4-week block is to build specific fitness for the 45-mile Fat Chuck's Revenge race. The "non-stop up and down" nature of this course requires high muscular endurance and the ability to sustain "comfortably hard" (Z3) to "hard" (Z4) efforts. The training structure is three weeks of loading followed by one week of recovery and taper, a common 3-on, 1-off protocol. Training will focus on sustained threshold efforts, muscular endurance (climbs), and extending the weekend long ride to 3-4 hours.

### 2.2 Mesocycle 2 - Taper & Race (Week 5: Dec 16-22)

This week is a taper, designed to shed accumulated fatigue from the build block while retaining fitness. The protocol involves a significant reduction in training volume, but a retention of high intensity through short "opener" workouts. This ensures the body is fresh, but the neuromuscular system remains primed for racing.

### 2.3 Mesocycle 3 - Recover & Reload (Weeks 6-7: Dec 23 - Jan 5)

This 2-week block bridges the two winter races. Week 6 is a dedicated recovery week, focused on low-intensity Z1/Z2 rides to facilitate adaptation and recovery from the 45-mile race. Week 7 is a "reload" block to prepare for the Excruciate Exam relay. Relay racing places a unique demand on the body: repeated, high-intensity efforts interspersed with periods of rest. To simulate this demand, a "two-a-day" training session is programmed on Tuesday, Dec 31st. This trains the body and mind for the "go hard, recover, go hard again" sequence of a relay.

## Section 3: Macrocycle 2 (Weeks 8-28): The BC Bike Race Campaign

This 21-week macrocycle is the primary focus of the plan, culminating in the 7-day BC Bike Race. This event requires a massive aerobic engine, deep muscular endurance, and the ability to recover and repeat high-intensity efforts for seven consecutive days. The plan is structured around classic periodization: Base, Build, and Peak/Taper.

### 3.1 Mesocycle 4 - Transition & Base 1 (Weeks 8-11: Jan 6 - Feb 2)

Following the winter races, Week 8 is a critical transition week, dedicated entirely to active recovery. This allows for full physical and mental regeneration before beginning the long build toward the BC Bike Race. Weeks 9-11 commence Base Phase 1. The exclusive focus is re-establishing the aerobic foundation by accumulating significant time in Zone 2. The strength program also resets, beginning Phase 2 (Maximum Strength) in alignment with this new base block.

### 3.2 Mesocycle 5 - Base 2 (Weeks 12-16: Feb 3 - Mar 9)

This is the most important training block for stage race success. The primary goal is extending aerobic endurance. This is achieved by progressively increasing the duration of the weekend long ride, building from 3 hours to 5 and eventually 6 hours. These long rides train metabolic efficiency (fat burning) and build the deep durability required for a 7-day event. Mid-week rides also increase in duration, focusing on Z2 and Z3.

### 3.3 Mesocycle 6 - Build 1 (Weeks 17-20: Mar 10 - Apr 6)

With a massive aerobic base established, this mesocycle begins to "build the ceiling" by introducing high-intensity training. The focus shifts from duration to intensity, specifically Z4 (Lactate Threshold) intervals. The weekend long ride remains, but it now incorporates sustained Z3 (Tempo) and Z4 (Threshold) efforts to simulate race-pace climbing. The strength program shifts in parallel, moving from raw strength to Phase 3 (Muscular Endurance).

### 3.4 Mesocycle 7 - Build 2 / Specialty (Weeks 21-24: Apr 7 - May 4)

This is the peak training block. It is designed to be the most difficult of the entire plan, pushing the body to its limits to force a final, "peak" adaptation. The focus is on Z5 (VO2 Max) intervals during the week and "Stage Race Simulation" blocks on the weekend.
This simulation is the key to this mesocycle. It involves back-to-back long, hard days.

* **Saturday:** A "Kitchen Sink" ride, 4-5 hours in duration, that includes a mix of all relevant intensities (Z3, Z4, and Z5 intervals).
* **Sunday:** A "Fatigued Endurance" ride, 3-4 hours in duration, performed on legs already depleted from Saturday's effort.

The primary adaptation from this block is not just fitness, but enhancing the body's ability to perform on subsequent days with significant fatigue. This trains metabolic efficiency, glycogen sparing, and the psychological resilience required to face the later stages of the BC Bike Race.

### 3.5 Mesocycle 8 - Taper & Peak (Weeks 25-27: May 5 - May 25)

Following the peak training block, a 3-week taper is required to shed all accumulated fatigue and allow the body to supercompensate.

* **Week 25 (Taper 1):** Volume is reduced by ~20-25%. A final, shortened "Stage Race Sim" block is performed.
* **Week 26 (Taper 2):** Volume is reduced by 40-50%. Intensity is maintained via short "opener" workouts.
* **Week 27 (Race Week):** Training volume is minimal, consisting only of short spins to keep the legs "open" and the body primed for Day 1.

### 3.6 Mesocycle 9 - Race Week (Week 28: May 23-29)

During the 7-day BC Bike Race, all training adaptation is complete. The entire focus shifts from fitness to execution and recovery. The daily plan is to race, and then immediately begin the recovery protocol to maximize performance for the following day.

**Daily Race/Recovery Protocol:**

1.  **Race:** Execute nutrition and pacing plan.
2.  **Post-Race (0-5 min):** Finish, begin rehydrating.
3.  **Post-Race (5-20 min):** Perform a 15-minute cool-down spin on a trainer or flat ground. This must be in Z1.
4.  **Post-Race (20-30 min):** Ingest immediate recovery nutrition (e.g., 30g protein, 60g carbohydrates).
5.  **Post-Race (30-90 min):** Rehydrate, stretch, foam roll, clean up.
6.  **Post-Race (2+ hours):** Eat a full, balanced meal. Prepare equipment for the next day. Rest. Sleep as much as possible.

## Section 4: The Integrated Strength & Conditioning Program

This periodized strength program is designed to be integrated into the cycling plan, with 2 sessions per week. The phases of strength training are aligned with the phases of the cycling macrocycle to support, not detract from, on-bike goals.

### 4.1 Phase 1 - Adaptation (Weeks 1-4)

* **Goal:** Prepare muscles, tendons, and ligaments for the stress of heavier training. This phase aligns with the Winter Build.
* **Protocol:** 3 sets of 15-20 repetitions. Load: Light (40-60% of 1-Rep Max, or 1RM). Rest: 1-2 minutes between sets.

#### Table 3: Phase 1 Workout (Adaptation)

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Weight | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Goblet Squat | 3 | 15-20 | Light | Form, muscle prep |
| Push-up (or Incline) | 3 | 15-20 | Bodyweight | Upper body endurance |
| Dumbbell Row | 3 | 15-20 | Light | Postural strength |
| Lunge | 3 | 15-20 | Light | Unilateral stability |
| Overhead Press | 3 | 15-20 | Light | Shoulder stability |
| Plank | 3 | 60s hold | Bodyweight | Core stabilization |

### 4.2 Phase 2 - Maximum Strength (Weeks 9-16)

* **Goal:** Improve maximum force production by enhancing neuromuscular recruitment. This phase aligns with the Base 1 and Base 2 blocks.
* **Protocol:** 3-5 sets of 3-6 repetitions. Load: Heavy (80-95% 1RM). Rest: 2-4 minutes between sets.

This low-rep, high-weight protocol builds neurological strength without adding significant muscle mass, thereby improving the crucial strength-to-weight ratio.

#### Table 4: Phase 2 Workout (Maximum Strength)

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Weight | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Barbell Squat or Leg Press | 4 | 3-6 | Heavy | Max leg force |
| Deadlift (or Trap Bar) | 4 | 3-6 | Heavy | Full-body power, posterior chain |
| Bench Press (or DB Press) | 3 | 3-6 | Heavy | Upper body strength |
| Pull-up or Lat Pulldown | 3 | 3-6 | Heavy | Pulling strength for bike control |
| Bulgarian Split Squat | 3 | 3-6 | Heavy | Unilateral strength, glute activation |

### 4.3 Phase 3 - Muscular Endurance (Weeks 17-24)

* **Goal:** Convert the raw strength from Phase 2 into sport-specific, fatigue-resistant power. This phase aligns with the Build 1 and Build 2 blocks.
* **Protocol:** 2-3 sets of 15-20 repetitions. Load: Medium. Rest: 1-2 minutes. The focus is on more dynamic, high-repetition movements.

#### Table 5: Phase 3 Workout (Muscular Endurance)

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Weight | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Kettlebell Swing | 3 | 20 | Medium | Explosive hip extension, power |
| Single-Leg Deadlift | 3 | 15 | Medium | Unilateral stability, endurance |
| Dumbbell Row | 3 | 15 | Medium | Postural endurance |
| Box Jump (or Squat Jump) | 3 | 10 | Bodyweight | Neuromuscular power |
| Russian Twist | 3 | 20 (each) | Medium | Rotational core strength |

### 4.4 Phase 4 - In-Season Maintenance (Weeks 25-28)

* **Goal:** Maintain strength and activation with minimal volume and fatigue during the taper and race week.
* **Protocol:** 1-2 sessions per week. 2 sets of 8-10 repetitions. Load: Medium.

#### Table 6: Phase 4 Workout (Maintenance)

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Weight | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Goblet Squat | 2 | 10 | Medium | Activation |
| Push-up | 2 | 10-15 | Bodyweight | Activation |
| Dumbbell Row | 2 | 10 | Medium | Activation |
| Plank | 2 | 60s hold | Bodyweight | Activation |

### 4.5 Core-Specific Routine (2-3x/week)

A strong core is the "connection point" that transfers power from the legs to the pedals and allows the upper body to control the bike. This 10-minute routine should be performed 2-3 times per week, ideally after easier Z2 rides.

#### Table 7: Core Routine (Perform as a circuit)

| Exercise | Reps / Duration |
| :--- | :--- |
| Plank | 60s hold |
| Side Plank (L/R) | 30s hold each side |
| Bird-Dog | 10 each side (slow, controlled) |
| Bicycle Crunches | 20 each side |
| Glute Bridge | 60s hold or 15 reps |
